  # Workarounds for various client bugs:
  #   delay-newmail:
  #     Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP
  #     and CHECK commands. Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX
  #     Mail (<v2.1). Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it
  #     may show user "Message no longer in server" errors. Note that OE6 still
  #     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to
  #     "Headers Only".
  #   netscape-eoh:
  #     Netscape 4.x breaks if message headers don't end with the empty "end of
  #     headers" line. Normally all messages have this, but setting this
  #     workaround makes sure that Netscape never breaks by adding the line if
  #     it doesn't exist. This is done only for FETCH BODY[HEADER.FIELDS..]
  #     commands. Note that RFC says this shouldn't be done.
  #   tb-extra-mailbox-sep:
  #     With mbox storage a mailbox can contain either mails or submailboxes,
  #     but not both. Thunderbird separates these two by forcing server to
  #     accept '/' suffix in mailbox names in subscriptions list.
  # The list is space-separated.

  #  %f - filename (maildir only)

  # idea to change this. %08Xu%08Xv should be pretty fail-safe.
  #
