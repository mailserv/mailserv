'220'=>'<domain> Service ready',
'221'=>'<domain> Service closing transmission channel',
'250'=>'Requested mail action taken and completed',	# Your ISP mail server have successfully executes a command and the DNS is reporting a positive delivery.
'251'=>'User not local: will forward to <forward-path>',	# Your message to a specified email address is not local to the mail server, but it will accept and forward the message to a different recipient email address.
'252'=>'Recipient cannot be verified',	# but mail server accepts the message and attempts delivery.
'354'=>'Start mail input and end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>',	# Indicates mail server is ready to accept the message or instruct your mail client to send the message body after the mail server have received the message headers.

'421'=>'<domain> Service not available, closing transmission channel',	# This may be a reply to any command if the service knows it must shut down.
'450'=>'Requested mail action not taken: mailbox busy, DNS check failed or access denied for other reason',	# Your ISP mail server indicates that an email address does not exist or the mailbox is busy. It could be the network connection went down while sending, or it could also happen if the remote mail server does not want to accept mail from you for some reason i.e. (IP address, From address, Recipient, etc.)
'451'=>'Requested mail action aborted: error in processing',	# Your ISP mail server indicates that the mailing has been interrupted, usually due to overloading from too many messages or transient failure is one in which the message sent is valid, but some temporary event prevents the successful sending of the message.

'453'=>'Too many messages',	# Some mail servers have the option to reduce the number of concurrent connection and also the number of messages sent per connection. If you have a lot of messages queued up it could go over the max number of messages per connection. To see if this is the case you can try submitting only a few messages to that domain at a time and then keep increasing the number until you find the maximum number accepted by the server.
