UPGRADING instructions
======================

Follow these instructions if upgrading from a previous version
of Roundcube Webmail. We recommend to carefully backup the existing
installation as well as the database before executig the following steps.

1. Replace index.php and all files in
   - ./bin/
   - ./SQL/
   - ./program/
   - ./installer/
   - ./skins/default/
   - ./plugins/
2. Run ./bin/update.sh from the commandline OR
   open http://url-to-roundcube/installer/ in a browser and choose "3 Test config".
   To enable the latter one, you have to temporary set 'enable_installer' to true
   in your local config/main.inc.php file.
3. Let the update script/installer check your configuration and
   update your config files as suggested by the updater.
4. If suggested by the update script, run all commands in
   ./SQL/[yourdbtype].update.sql that are superscribed with the
   currently installed version number.
5. Make sure 'enable_installer' is set to false again.
6. Check .htaccess settings (some php settings could become required)
