Adding other items to the menu
==============================
The command rcm_contextmenu_register_command allows other plugins to add items to the context menu.
IMPORTANT: The context menu plugin must be initialised before any other plugin which adds an item to the menu.

rcm_contextmenu_register_command(command, callback, label [, pos [, sep [, multi ]]])
 command: the name of the command eg: spam
 callback: the name of the function which should be called when the menu item is clicked
 label: the name of the label to use in the menu
 (optional) pos: class name of a existing item in the menu which the new item should be inserted before, if no pos is specified the item is added to the end
 (optional) sep: [before|after] put a separating line before or after this item
 (optional) multi: [true|false] should the item be enabled when multiple messages are selected
 (optional) addsub: [true|false] add the new item to a sub menu
 (optional) obj: the menu object to which the item should be added
