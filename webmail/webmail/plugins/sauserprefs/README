Roundcube Webmail SpamAssassin User Prefs (SQL)
===============================================
This plugin adds the ability for users to edit they SpamAssassin user prefs from within RoundCube. It interacts with preferences storied in a database via SQL.
Tested with SpamAssassin Version 3.2.3
Inspiration for this plugin was taken from:
WebUserPrefs <http://sourceforge.net/projects/webuserprefs/>

Install
=======
* Place this plugin folder into plugins directory of RoundCube
* Add sauserprefs to $rcmail_config['plugins'] in your RoundCube config
NB: When downloading the plugin from GitHub you will need to create a directory called sauserprefs and place the files in there, ignoring the root directory in the downloaded archive

Config
======
The default config file is plugins/sauserprefs/config.inc.php.dist
Rename this to plugins/sauserprefs/config.inc.php
* You must set the database connection string
* Enter the table name, name of the username field, preference field, and value field

Changing the order of the sections
==================================
To change the order of the sections add a sections attribute with the sections listed in the desired order to the sasectionslist object in skins/[skin]/templates/sauserprefs.html
eg: <roundcube:object name="sasectionslist" id="sections-table" class="records-table" cellspacing="0" sections="general,tests,bayes,headers,report,addresses" />

Whitelist Sync
==============
This plugin contains an option to synchronise changes to your RC address book and your SpamAssassin whitelist.

Delete user bayesian data stored in database
============================================
If the bayesian data is stored in the same database as the user prefs then it is possible for users to delete their data from the UI.
